      <description>Algorithm investigation experts Tracking Exposed have exclusively uncovered that TikTok has blocked an estimated 95% of content previously available to its 55 million users in Russia.
The content is restricted at the application layer rather than the transport layer, which requires the direct involvement of TikTok. It is the first time a global social media platform has restricted access to content at this scale. TikTok users in Russia can no longer see content on accounts run by foreign media such as the BBC, or from Tiktokâ€™s biggest stars including Charlie d&amp;rsquo;Amelio.</description>
