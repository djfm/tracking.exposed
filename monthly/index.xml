Online pornography, like other forms of cultural production, is increasingly subject to processes of platformization. While research has focused on the diffusion of online pornography and its broader implications, less attention has been paid to the algorithmic infrastructures through which platforms distribute and manage pornographic content, and how this might reiterate socially embedded views and perspectives. To fill this gap, we consider how Pornhub, currently the leading porn platform, establishes the gender identity of its users, and how this affects the structure of the platform and the distribution and recommendation of content within it.</description>

      <description>January 2022 was an exciting time, as youchoose; despite being ready to launch, it underwent a revamp of the site and the offer.
Unfortunately, the search for YouTubers to promote the initiative was unsuccessful, it&amp;rsquo;s sad to report, but the YouTubers are afraid of the repercussions that installing youchoose could have on them as if google would punish them for it. Again, it&amp;rsquo;s sad because, on the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a defeatist mentality of those who, in fear of being punished by the boss, prefer the status quo.</description>

      <description>2021 was the first year in which we were supported with a growth direction. We are grateful for the support of the DATACTIVE team who between 2018 and 2020 allowed us to grow and be more utilised by the academy world, but the quantum leap of 2021 was a turning point in the life of the Tracking Exposed project.
The most fortunate meeting was with Marc Faddoul, a researcher and analyst who shared experiences and passion for algorithm analysis, with a great capacity for fundraising and product design that we lacked.</description>

      <description>Although the project didn&amp;rsquo;t update these entries, the Spring + Summer 2021 was an awakening list of months behind the scenes. We are developing a more robust method of algorithm accountability, more platforms, partnerships, and concepts.
All the variety of Tracking Exposed is taking shape as long as the team grew, in parallel the public demand for our kind of services grows, as so are new actors in the field.</description>

      <description>Ongoing project PAADC announced The tool of facebook.tracking.exposed, developed in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam, partnered with I&amp;amp;O poll and other analysts. 2000 Dutch were invited and 600 actives in the collection.
In this way, we re-framed the browser extension, reduced the interaction offered to adopters by removing the popup, updated the privacy statement explaining who is going to process the data, and collect posts on a dedicated server.</description>

      <description>Completed and submitted a paper made from the experiment named weTest1. We used a variety of analysis. For example network visualization enhanced clusters and highlight patterns:  A few months ago, we had insights thanks to such kind of analysis, after a collaborative observation of pornhub [report page, SFW]. The Adult site tests related content on newly uploaded videos. We reused it on YouTube. If you want a takeaway of this paragraph: pornhub and youtube, acts differently in regarding of testing emerging contents.</description>

 There were a few of progress in YouTube aria-label analysis, as is used in the format developed for weTest1, now we can mine machine readable information from natural language strings. Updated Material-UI library, enhanced youtube popup Implemented a mechanism to analyze searches results from YouTube. Temporarily suspended facebook.tracking.exposed (a database and disk upgrade, plus the implementation of strongest auto-cleaning data policies)  Update: after a few days of down, database is now operative.</description>

      <description>On data retention Actions performed On facebook.tracking.exposed we purge cyclically data. The data is backup and not accessible as historical reference. This because might be interesting, in the future, see how Facebook HTML and timelines looked like back in time. The data collected from our infrastructure is divided in two group:
 information submitted by browser extension information generated by us, based on the data above, still inheriting ownership.  The data on point 1 are subject to our data retention policy, our primary goal on this is don&amp;rsquo;t fill the hard drive because that is our bottleneck.</description>

      <description>In regards of facebook.tracking.exposed, it is available browser extension v2.0. New adopters get a splash screen on the first Facebook access, old adopters, should notice a logo upgrade. Surprisingly, despite we weren&amp;rsquo;t provide many updates on fbtrex, we see a constant curiosity from the internet (press on the months button to see wider). This work has been done by Alberto Granzotto, also as the first browser extension, and would help us in supporting more platforms.</description>

      <description>A new experiment happen! the first collaborative observation on the pornhub algorithm, we should follow-up shortly with our final report and announcement of the next test. As part of the Amsterdam DMI winter school, we lead two groups, in which students and researcher analyzed youtube algorithm and Amazon algorithm too (report not yet available, because it is a bit bigger than common) Created an ethics page on poTREX We upgraded our framework in using webslide too, please give a look to this documentation!</description>

A documentary in the Italian national TV been aired featuring us! we produced our first analysis of Amazon. If you speak italian, please skip the first 2:18 and watch the episode &amp;ldquo;Il mondo (segreto) di Amazon&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In the summer we were at our peak with people hired for ALEX project. This proven to be quite an hard task, because we have to onboard the new collaborators, and be clear in our task specification.  We have a new brand and style! It should be more organic and has proved value to talk with people in communication sector. We contribute to our first Datathon, organized with berlin Data Science Social Good.</description>

      <description>In the spring, three unique things have been completed:  https://eu19.tracking.exposed, finally, our announced European election monitor. This has been also the first experiment using HUGO as new framework to build our *.tracking.exposed websites; The semantic API have been released, and they allow to query by topics. A young and talented collaborator meet at the Winter School had to do a bachelor thesis on algorithm in pornography, and we start to work on the analysis of the Pornhub algorithm, by using the same technology developed for the YouTube algorithm analysis!</description>

      <description>After the last year&amp;rsquo;s CCC talk and the 2017-2018 project report, we describe here the progress made during January.  Started splitting the project between Algorithm Exposed, Facebook Tracking Exposed(https://facebook.tracking.exposed) which will be more technical and the various campaigns such as EU19(https://eu19.tracking.exposed). Prepared a document that defines Tracking Exposed as a brand. It helps communicating complex concepts when we open up as a community by clarifying what we do and how we do it.</description>
