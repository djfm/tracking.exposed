        | Information diet: we oppose to the idea that technology might tell you what is a fake news, a validated news, a trusted source, etc. Technology can’t replace critical judgment. Our goal is to compare the information you are exposed during your facebook experience, with a larger and differentiated set of sources. The user would decide if he’s happy with what is exposed on facebook or rather whether he thinks he should enlarge his information base.
