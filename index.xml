      <description>On March 15, 2022, Tracking Exposed released a special report documenting our investigation into TikTokâ€™s content restrictions in Russia, which was picked up by news outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, Vice News, Le Monde, and WIRED Italia. It also gained substantial traction on Twitter.
Today we release a special 24 page report into TikTokâ€™s activities in Russia. Our researchers exclusively discovered that TikTok has blocked an estimated 95% of content previously available to its 55 million users in Russia ~without announcing this move~ https://t.</description>

      <description>Algorithm investigation experts Tracking Exposed have exclusively uncovered that TikTok has blocked an estimated 95% of content previously available to its 55 million users in Russia.
The content is restricted at the application layer rather than the transport layer, which requires the direct involvement of TikTok. It is the first time a global social media platform has restricted access to content at this scale. TikTok users in Russia can no longer see content on accounts run by foreign media such as the BBC, or from Tiktokâ€™s biggest stars including Charlie d&amp;rsquo;Amelio.</description>

Online pornography, like other forms of cultural production, is increasingly subject to processes of platformization. While research has focused on the diffusion of online pornography and its broader implications, less attention has been paid to the algorithmic infrastructures through which platforms distribute and manage pornographic content, and how this might reiterate socially embedded views and perspectives. To fill this gap, we consider how Pornhub, currently the leading porn platform, establishes the gender identity of its users, and how this affects the structure of the platform and the distribution and recommendation of content within it.</description>

      <description>January 2022 was an exciting time, as youchoose; despite being ready to launch, it underwent a revamp of the site and the offer.
Unfortunately, the search for YouTubers to promote the initiative was unsuccessful, it&amp;rsquo;s sad to report, but the YouTubers are afraid of the repercussions that installing youchoose could have on them as if google would punish them for it. Again, it&amp;rsquo;s sad because, on the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a defeatist mentality of those who, in fear of being punished by the boss, prefer the status quo.</description>

      <description>2021 was the first year in which we were supported with a growth direction. We are grateful for the support of the DATACTIVE team who between 2018 and 2020 allowed us to grow and be more utilised by the academy world, but the quantum leap of 2021 was a turning point in the life of the Tracking Exposed project.
The most fortunate meeting was with Marc Faddoul, a researcher and analyst who shared experiences and passion for algorithm analysis, with a great capacity for fundraising and product design that we lacked.</description>

      <description>Although the project didn&amp;rsquo;t update these entries, the Spring + Summer 2021 was an awakening list of months behind the scenes. We are developing a more robust method of algorithm accountability, more platforms, partnerships, and concepts.
All the variety of Tracking Exposed is taking shape as long as the team grew, in parallel the public demand for our kind of services grows, as so are new actors in the field.</description>

      <description>Ongoing project PAADC announced The tool of facebook.tracking.exposed, developed in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam, partnered with I&amp;amp;O poll and other analysts. 2000 Dutch were invited and 600 actives in the collection.
In this way, we re-framed the browser extension, reduced the interaction offered to adopters by removing the popup, updated the privacy statement explaining who is going to process the data, and collect posts on a dedicated server.</description>

      <description>Completed and submitted a paper made from the experiment named weTest1. We used a variety of analysis. For example network visualization enhanced clusters and highlight patterns:  A few months ago, we had insights thanks to such kind of analysis, after a collaborative observation of pornhub [report page, SFW]. The Adult site tests related content on newly uploaded videos. We reused it on YouTube. If you want a takeaway of this paragraph: pornhub and youtube, acts differently in regarding of testing emerging contents.</description>

      <description>Excerpt from Thinking outside the blackbox.
Algorithmic Sovereignty in Theory With â€˜algorithmic sovereigntyâ€™ in social media we generally intend to regulate the use of information filtering and personalization design choices according to democratic principles, setting their scope for private purposes, and harnessing their power for the public good. In other words, to open black-boxed personalization algorithms of (mainstream) social media to users and public institutions.
While there have been discussions on the ethics of recommender systems and personalization (Bozdag, 2011; Helberger, 2019; Milano, Taddeo &amp;amp; Floridi 2019), and on how to fulfil main algorithmic principles such as fairness, transparency, accountability, accuracy and privacy (algo:aware, 2018), in this hypothetical radical scenario, algorithms could even be exchanged, remixed, tested, plugged, and even sold or rented.</description>

This because might be interesting, in the future, see how Facebook HTML and timelines looked like back in time. The data collected from our infrastructure is divided in two group:
 information submitted by browser extension information generated by us, based on the data above, still inheriting ownership.  The data on point 1 are subject to our data retention policy, our primary goal on this is don&amp;rsquo;t fill the hard drive because that is our bottleneck.</description>

What is the purpose of the Netflix site, both for the end user and for the provider? For end users, the use of Netflix recommendations is to find relevant content that they want to watch at that specific time. Imagine that you didnâ€™t have any ordering or filtering. How would you ever find anything in the Netflix catalog when it has more than 10,000 items?</description>

      <description>In regards of facebook.tracking.exposed, it is available browser extension v2.0. New adopters get a splash screen on the first Facebook access, old adopters, should notice a logo upgrade. Surprisingly, despite we weren&amp;rsquo;t provide many updates on fbtrex, we see a constant curiosity from the internet (press on the months button to see wider). This work has been done by Alberto Granzotto, also as the first browser extension, and would help us in supporting more platforms.</description>

      <description>Dear friend! If you did something for tracking.exposed: cool! Sadly, your effort is not over yet, until your action gets adequately reported in our production list. The file is of â€˜analysis-and-publicationâ€™! our list of projectâ€™s success and yours should be there too. We should save each advocacy effort. Articles published that talk about us, and of course our productions.
You&amp;rsquo;ve to edit (or propose a pull request) to this file on github, which become like a list of events in the end.</description>

The presentation was new but without any original research.

      <description>We operate in small, mono focus, projects*. &amp;ldquo;Facebook&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Pornhub&amp;rdquo; are two mono-focus projects for us. &amp;ldquo;European Election algorithm analysis&amp;rdquo; is another one.
All the volunteers contribute freely expecting acknowledgment for their effort and offering quality time. Generally, we team up with people and organization who understand and share the manifesto. Being proactive in developing an idea is extra appreciated, as per Autumn 2019, we run understaffed and underfunded. We don&amp;rsquo;t have solutions for these issues yet.</description>

      <description>a 2016 memory After the EndSummerCamp, Luca Corsato reaches out to me (Claudio) briefly, after the presentation of fbtrex. He was one of the many mentioning an interest in helping us. Well, but in this case the help was real ;) The collaborator of Luca, Andrea Raimondi, begin to listen and guide me and the project in the very first phases of the project. We planned the alpha release, used TAIGA to do some project management, Andrea, with my inputs, wrote the opening text which lasts for years in homepage.</description>

This has been also the first experiment using HUGO as new framework to build our *.tracking.exposed websites; The semantic API have been released, and they allow to query by topics. A young and talented collaborator meet at the Winter School had to do a bachelor thesis on algorithm in pornography, and we start to work on the analysis of the Pornhub algorithm, by using the same technology developed for the YouTube algorithm analysis!</description>

      <description>Zuckless News feed has rolled out ahead of the 2019 European elections! Our goal and experiment is (in the long term) in build informed citizens. Simulating the source selection rather than delegate to an algorithm.  Facebook does not enable us to understand or control how our news feed content is selected, and has even been found to provide different users seeking the same information completely different lenses through which to perceive of the subject, as Eli Pariser discovered.</description>

      <description>After the last year&amp;rsquo;s CCC talk and the 2017-2018 project report, we describe here the progress made during January.  Started splitting the project between Algorithm Exposed, Facebook Tracking Exposed(https://facebook.tracking.exposed) which will be more technical and the various campaigns such as EU19(https://eu19.tracking.exposed). Prepared a document that defines Tracking Exposed as a brand. It helps communicating complex concepts when we open up as a community by clarifying what we do and how we do it.</description>

      <description>Tracking Exposed Manifesto   Our main objective is to put a spotlight on users&#39; tracking, profiling, on the data market and on the influence of algorithms. As long as these phenomena are shielded from view or understood only by experts, they cannot be tackled with the political determination that problems of such magnitude deserve. That is why we strive to explain the issue, test and promote new solutions, developed to benefit the community.</description>

Thanks for being resilient and contributing to the project. Despite the apparence, the project is doing OK. Besides&amp;hellip; we have not yet offer features to you because it turns out, we achieved exciting results in research, and this was simpler than develop an UX.
Now the things are going to change, perhaps. Since version 1.1.15 (released 2018-07-17), the new personal dashboard has begun to be deployed.</description>
